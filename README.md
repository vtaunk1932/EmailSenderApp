## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
* Apache Maven
* Node.js and npm

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vtaunk1932/EmailSenderApp.git](https://github.com/vtaunk1932/EmailSenderApp.git)
    cd EmailSenderApp
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Terminal 1):**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    # (Assuming it's named 'emailsenderapp', change if necessary)
    cd emailsenderapp

    # Configure your email credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties`
    # You MUST add your SMTP server details (host, username, password) here.

    # Run the backend server
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend API will now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

3.  **Frontend Setup (Terminal 2):**
    Open a **new terminal window** for this step.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory

    cd path/to/your/frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Run the React application
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
